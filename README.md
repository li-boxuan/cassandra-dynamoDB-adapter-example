# Cassandra DynamoDB Adapter Example

This is an example project to demonstrate how to use [cassandra-dynamoDB-adapter](https://github.com/stargate/dynamoDB-adapter)
to run your DynamoDB workloads on Apache Cassandra.

**:warning: NOTE**

This repository was originally created by students in the Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) program at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) as a [capstone project](https://mcds-cmu.github.io/11632/f22/). The repository has been donated to the Stargate project to demonstrate how to use an API Service created according to the [Stargate v2 architecture](https://stargate.io/2022/10/26/stargate-v2-ga.html). 

The adapter is not a full implementation of the Dynamo DB API and is not considered production ready, or officially supported by the Stargate project at this time.

## Quick Start

Please refer to [dynamoDB-adapter](https://github.com/stargate/dynamoDB-adapter) and set up your
Cassandra + Stargate coordinator + DynamoDB adapter cluster.

Then, you should be able to run the DynamoSampleApp using maven or IDE (Intellij IDEA is recommended).
